# competitive-programming

## What is it?
I spent a significant amount of time preparing for **LMIO** competitions, so I have
a solid collection of **olympiad-level tasks** on my computer.  
In this repository, I decided to share some of my favorite challenges.

The tasks are mostly from **LMIO** and **ŠIOM**.  
For those familiar with LMIO, the selected problems come from the **city and national
levels** (2nd and 3rd stages).

## What is used?
- **Language:** C++
- Since these are **olympiad tasks**, optimization is a must.

## So how is optimization achieved?
In these tasks you can find various algorithms, such as:
- DFS
- BFS
- Dynamic programming
- Binary search  
- and others

## Notes
Keep in mind that the code is **not written with styling as a priority**.  
It is intended for **competitive programming**, where the main focus is on
**correctness, efficiency, and speed**, not readability.
